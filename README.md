The OCR-A font is one of the two typefaces accepted by the U.S. government for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), alongside OCR-B.

Standard

OCR-A is defined by ANSI INCITS 17-1981 (R2000) (formerly ANSI X3.17-1981 (R2000)), which specifies the shapes and dimensions of the characters.

Sizes

OCR-A can be printed in three different sizes—I, III, and IV—to accommodate a variety of printing devices. Each size is distinguished by its scale factor and stroke width:

Size I – used for typewriters and printers

Size III – used by cash registers and accounting machines

Size IV – used by credit card imprinters

Licensing

The OCR-A font is free for both personal and commercial use.
